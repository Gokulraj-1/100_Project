                <h1>What are the Types of Cryptocurrency ?</h1>
                <p>Although some people use the terms crypto, coins, and tokens interchangeably, they are not the same
                    things. To gain a basic understanding of cryptocurrency, it’s important to understand how these
                    terms differ from one another.
                    Cryptocurrencies generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
                <p><span>Coins:</span> Can include Bitcoin and altcoins (all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin)</p>
                <p><span>Tokens:</span> Programmable assets that live within the blockchain of a given platform</p>
                <p>The term altcoin refers to all cryptocurrencies other than Bitcoin. Some main types of altcoins
                    include mining-based cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, security tokens, and utility tokens.</p>
