                <h1>What is Cryptocurrency?</h1>
                <p>A cryptocurrency is a digital currency, which is an alternative form of payment
                  created using encryption algorithms. The use of encryption technologies means that cryptocurrencies
                  function both as a currency and as a virtual accounting system.<br> To use cryptocurrencies, you need a 
                  cryptocurrency wallet</p>

                <h1>What is crypto wallet?</h1>
                <p>Crypto wallets store private keys, the passwords that give you access to your cryptocurrencies.
                   Crypto wallets can be either “hot wallets,” meaning they are connected to the Internet, or “cold wallets,” meaning they are offline.
                   Hot wallets are generally more susceptible to being hacked than cold wallets, so the best practice is to use a cold wallet for the long-term storage of cryptocurrencies.</p>

                <h1>Where can investors can buy Bitcoin?</h1>
                <p>Examples of ways investors can buy bitcoin include going on a cryptocurrency trading platform or buying a bitcoin ETF.
                    There are pros and cons to each method of access. For example, bitcoin ETFs have the advantage of being able to be
                    held in a registered account (e.g., TFSA or RRSP). However, while investors can buy and sell bitcoin 24/7 on a cryptocurrency trading platform,
                    investors can only trade bitcoin ETFs during regular market hours.</p>

                <p>Bitcoin is an open source project, with no official entity controlling the Bitcoin network. Anyone can review Bitcoin’s 
                code and propose changes. There are many compatible versions of Bitcoin network software, but a distribution of the software
                known as “Bitcoin Core” is currently the most widely adopted and provides the de facto standard for the Bitcoin protocol.</p>

                <h1> What is the main difference between bitcoin and NFTs?</h1>
                <p> Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are blockchain tokens that are not in general mutually interchangeable. In contrast, bitcoin is a fungible token,
                    meaning that one bitcoin can be readily exchanged for another bitcoin, much in the same way one Canadian dollar can be exchanged for another
                    Canadian dollar.</p>
